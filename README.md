# mpump v0.2.0

Hot-plug MIDI sequencer for Roland AIRA Compact devices. Plug in a device and it starts playing immediately. Unplug it and it stops cleanly. No configuration files, no drivers — just USB and sound.

Multiple devices play in sync from a shared clock. Switching patterns or pausing a device waits for the next bar boundary so everything stays phase-locked.

Built for live use: run it before the set, leave it going, connect and disconnect hardware as needed.

---

## Install

```bash
pip install mpump
```

Requires Python 3.11+ and macOS (CoreMIDI). All supported devices are USB class-compliant — no extra drivers needed.

---

## Two interfaces

### Terminal UI (recommended)

```bash
mpump-ui
```

Three-panel TUI showing S-1, T-8 and J-6 side by side. Browse and commit patterns live.

### Headless CLI

```bash
mpump
```

Starts immediately with the given flags, no UI.

## Supported devices

| Device | Type | MIDI |
|---|---|---|
| **Roland S-1** | Monosynth (AIRA Compact) | Genre patterns — melodic/bass lines with slides and accents |
| **Roland T-8** | Drum machine (AIRA Compact) | Independent drum + bass patterns; drums on Ch 10, bass on Ch 2 |
| **Roland J-6** | Chord synth (AIRA Compact) | Chord-stab progressions on Ch 1; auto-selects chord set via Program Change |
| **Roland SP-404MK2** | Sampler | Fixed pad-trigger pattern on Ch 1 |

---

## Terminal UI (`mpump-ui`)

```bash
mpump-ui                                        # defaults
mpump-ui --bpm 133 --genre acid-techno --pattern 3
mpump-ui --t8-genre dub-techno --t8-pattern 5 --t8-bass-pattern 2
mpump-ui --j6-genre trance --j6-pattern 4
```

### Key bindings

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Tab` | Cycle focus: S-1 → T-8 → J-6 |
| `← / →` | Previous / next genre |
| `↑ / ↓` | Previous / next pattern (browse only) |
| `Enter` | Commit browsed pattern/genre to device |
| `b / B` | T-8 bass pattern down / up (browse only) |
| `k / K` | Root key down / up (immediate, S-1 and T-8) |
| `o / O` | Octave down / up (immediate, S-1 and T-8) |
| `Space` | Pause / resume focused device |
| `= / -` | BPM +5 / −5 |
| `q` | Quit |

Browse with `← → ↑ ↓` (and `b/B` for bass) then press `Enter` to apply. The now-playing strip always shows what is actually running.

## Pattern library

### S-1 — 150 patterns, 15 genres × 10

Genres: `techno`, `acid-techno`, `trance`, `dub-techno`, `idm`, `edm`, `drum-and-bass`, `house`, `breakbeat`, `jungle`, `garage`, `ambient`, `glitch`, `electro`, `downtempo`

All patterns are expressed as semitone offsets from the root, so `--key` and `--octave` transpose them freely.

```bash
mpump --list           # full catalogue with descriptions
```

### T-8 — 150 drum + 150 bass patterns, 15 genres × 10 each

Drum and bass patterns are selected independently. The bass runs on Ch 2; drums on Ch 10 (GM).

```bash
mpump --list-t8        # drum patterns
mpump --list-t8-bass   # bass patterns
```

### J-6 — 150 chord progressions, 15 genres × 10

Root is always C (MIDI 60). On connect, mpump sends a Program Change to auto-select the matching chord set on the J-6.

```bash
mpump --list-j6
```

---

## Sync model

All devices share a single step-grid anchored to a global `t0`. Every sequencer starts at the next **bar boundary** (16 steps from `t0`), so:

- Devices that connect at different times are always phase-locked within one bar
- Pattern changes and pause/resume introduce at most one bar of delay, then re-enter on the beat
- BPM changes reset `t0` and batch-restart all devices at the same boundary

MIDI clock (24 PPQN) is sent to each device for BPM-synced effects (LFO, delay, arpeggiator). No MIDI Start/Stop messages are sent, so the devices' internal sequencers are not triggered.

---

## How slides work

On acid patterns, steps marked `slide=True` send the next `note_on` before the previous `note_off`. On a monosynth like the S-1, this triggers legato / portamento if portamento is enabled on the device.
